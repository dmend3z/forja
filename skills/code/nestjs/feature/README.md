## What it does

The nestjs-coder agent builds NestJS backend applications following the framework's modular architecture. It creates modules with controllers and services, uses class-validator DTOs for request validation, integrates Prisma for database access, and implements dependency injection patterns. The agent follows NestJS naming conventions and decorators.

## Usage

After installing with `forja install code/nestjs/feature`:

```bash
# Use the nestjs-coder agent for NestJS implementation
nestjs-coder
```

The agent follows these standards:
- Modular architecture (feature modules)
- Controllers for routing, Services for business logic
- class-validator DTOs for validation
- Prisma for database operations
- Dependency injection with @Injectable()

forja install code/nestjs/feature
